## Description

The Knight Rider Arduino project is an exciting and educational project that replicates the iconic "Knight Rider" LED animation on a strip of LEDs using an Arduino microcontroller. This project is inspired by the famous Knight Industries Two Thousand (KITT) car from the 1980s TV series.

## Features

- Simulates the classic "Knight Rider" LED animation.
- Uses an Arduino microcontroller for control.
- Easy to customize and adapt for different LED configurations.
- Great for learning about Arduino programming and controlling LEDs.


## Requirements

To run the Knight Rider Arduino project, you will need the following:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)
- A strip of LEDs or individual LEDs
- Jumper wires
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
